# Server Scripts Directory

This directory is reserved for standalone CLI scripts and maintenance utilities.

## Usage Guidelines

Place standalone scripts here such as:

- Database migration utilities
- Data import/export scripts
- Maintenance tasks
- CLI tools for development

## Note

Regular application server modules should remain in the `server/` directory root. Only discrete executable scripts belong here.
