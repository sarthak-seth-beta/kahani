    answer:
      "A keepsake book with their stories, photos, and QR codes to hear their voices.",

    answer: "No app, no login. Everything happens on WhatsApp.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can they speak in Hindi or another language?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Any Indian language works — the book keeps their voice just as it is.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take?",
    answer: "Usually 2–4 weeks after the stories are sent.",

    question: "Can I gift this?",
